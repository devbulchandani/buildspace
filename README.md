# 🚀 Buildpace AI

**Your project-aware AI coding mentor that learns from your GitHub.**

---

## ✨ Overview

Buildpace AI is an **AI-powered, project-first learning mentor for developers**. It helps learners move from *ideas → structured plan → real working code* by combining:

* Personalized learning plans generated by AI
* GitHub-based real code analysis
* Automated milestone verification
* Context-aware mentorship via MCP tools
* Live Socratic guidance inside your code editor or LLM

Instead of measuring learning with quizzes, Buildpace AI measures progress using **your actual codebase**.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🧠 1) AI-Generated Learning Plans

Users specify:

* What they want to learn (e.g., "Spring Boot + React")
* Time available (e.g., 6 weeks)
* Skill level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

The Spring Boot backend (powered by **Gemini 3**) generates a structured learning plan divided into clear, actionable milestones.

### 🔗 2) GitHub Integration + Code Understanding

Users connect their GitHub repository to their plan.

A custom **repo_analyzer MCP** lets the AI:

* Inspect project structure (`analyze_repo`)
* Read individual files (`read_file`)
* Read multiple files (`read_files`)

This enables real, project-based feedback instead of generic advice.

### ✅ 3) AI Milestone Verification

When a user feels ready, they can request **milestone verification**.

The AI:

* Reads their repository via MCP
* Checks whether milestone requirements are met
* Either:

  * ✅ Approves the milestone, or
  * ❌ Rejects it with detailed, constructive feedback

Think of this as an automated technical reviewer + mentor.

### 🧩 4) buildpace_mcp — Your Personal Context Bridge

For every learning plan, Buildpace AI generates a custom **buildpace_mcp** server that can be plugged into tools like:

* Claude
* Cursor
* VS Code with AI
* Any MCP-compatible LLM

It exposes tools such as:

* `get_learning_plan`
* `get_current_milestone`
* `get_milestone_details`
* `get_progress`
* `get_socratic_guidance`

This gives your AI assistant full awareness of **what you’re building, where you are, and how to guide you—Socratically—while you code.**

## 🎯 Demo Flow

1. User creates a learning plan.
2. User links a GitHub repository.
3. User builds the project locally.
4. AI mentor analyzes progress via MCP.
5. User requests milestone verification.
6. AI approves or gives feedback.
7. User adds `buildpace_mcp` to their code editor for live mentorship.
